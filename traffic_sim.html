                            This project is a traffic simulation which uses an animator to
                            display vehicles, traffic lights, an intersection, and lanes of traffic.
                            The vehicles include cars, SUVs, and trucks. <br> <br>

                            This was implemented by Zohaib and Rinki. <br> <br>
                            This is version 1 of the project.

                                Our Main file checks for the correct command line inputs for execution.
                                The parameter file and the long are passed to our Simulation file.
                                <br> <br>
                                The simulation file consists of many different cohesive methods. We use the
                                parameter file to set the traffic lights to their according location.
                                <br> <br>
                                We create and spawn vehicles based on their probability of vehicle types,
                                their initial directions, and keep track of these vehicles in a vector of
                                vehicleBase pointers. Additionally, vehicle IDs are also kept track of
                                in a vector of integers.
                                <br> <br>
                                Vehicles have indices of where they exist on the road, their original direction,
                                and their current direction as attributes, among other attributes.
                            </div>

                            <h2>Spawning and Rolling</h2>
                            <div class="traffic_info">
                                The spawn method and roll method help insert a car into sections of the road.
                                Both work with integers keeping track of the number of vehicles fully spawned
                                or fully rolled in order to add vehicles in the order of creation and in
                                the increasing numerical order of their vehicle IDs. They also use an integer
                                pointerCounter to check how many pointers are assigned to a vehicle as it's
                                being spawned/rolled.
                                <br><br>
                                Throughout the project, we make sure that the vehicle's current direction
                                is considered by a temporary vehicleBase pointer vector that is assigned
                                to the road that corresponds to the vehicle's current direction to assign pointers.
                                After road section pointers of the vehicle's direction are manipulated, we reassign
                                the road vehicleBase pointer vectors to the value's in the temporary vector.
                                This way the changes in pointers persists beyond the scope of the methods.
                            </div>

                            <h2>Differences Between Spawning and Rolling</h2>
                            <div class="traffic_info">
                                The spawn method specifically places vehicles on empty road sections without
                                placing vehicles on the intersection. The roll method places vehicles
                                section by section on the end of the road if the end of the road is empty for
                                each section to roll in. We have multiple vehicles spawn before vehicles roll in.
                                <br><br>
                                Rolling works by checking the number of pointers are to a vehicle by a temporary
                                integer and making sure front sections rolled before the back sections. If a
                                vehicle was able to fully roll, we increment an integer representing the
                                indices of our vector to move on the next vehicle to fully roll.
                                This prevents vehicles from remaining partially rolled.
                                We roll each vehicle in order.
                            </div>

                            <h2>Despawning After Spawning / Fully Rolling</h2>
                            <div class="traffic_info">
                                We added a despawn attribute to vehicleBases to make sure cars that have
                                spawned/fully rolled into the road then successfully rolled off the road
                                can be kept track of. This prevents the code from accessing any vehicle that
                                have despawned and are no longer needed to preform any changes to.
                            </div>

                            <h2>Moving and Turning</h2>
                            <div class="traffic_info">
                                Both moving and turning keep track of the traffic light corresponding to the
                                direction it's currently traveling in by comparing the variables of string lights
                                that indicate the color of a particular light at a given time. We use this string
                                and the vehicle's direction to compare if a move or turn is possible.
                                <br><br>
                                We use a temporary vehicleBase pointer vector when manipulating pointers of the
                                road sections to vehicles as we did in spawning/rolling methods.
                                <br><br>
                                We keep track of where a given vehicle is by looping through the road sections
                                to see where the first index of a vehicle is on the road.
                                <br><br>
                                Moving / turning only occurs when a given vehicle exists on the road to move.

                                A move is deemed possible if the following cases are satisfied:

                                If a forward move is possible, we point the last section of the vehicle to nothing
                                and the next section to the vehicle to simulate a forward move. If the vehicle
                                has moved off of the screen fully, we despawn the vehicle.

                                <ul class="traffic_list">
                                    <li>
                                        a turn is not already in progress for the vehicle
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        the vehicle has a green light                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        the vehicle is in the section right before the intersection
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        there is no vehicle on the intersection ahead of the vehicle
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        the lane the vehicle is turning onto has space after and at the intersection
                                        to allow the vehicle to turn onto the new road direction
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                If a left turn is possible, we keep track of the vehicle's direction, index,
                                if a turn is in progress, manipulating the index of a vehicle when turning from
                                one direction to another direction. When a vehicle turns we have additional temporary
                                vehicleBase pointer vectors corresponding to the road direction that the vehicle
                                turned onto, and the road direction that the vehicle turned from.

                                VehicleBase objects implement copy constructor, copy assignment operator, move constructor,
                                move assignment operator, passing by rvalue and lvalue. This helps the correct
                                information be copied/moved as needed when manipulating vehicles. Pointers were heavily
                                used throughout this project. We use many vectors of vehicleBase pointers, and
                                we temporarily store the address of a vehicle which gets assigned the
                                dereferenced vehicle in our vehicleBase pointer vector keeping track of vehicles.
                                This makes sure changes to the vehicle persists outside the scope of methods,
                                within our vectors keeping track of vehicles, and the road sections pointer manipulations
                                persist beyond the scope of our methods.
